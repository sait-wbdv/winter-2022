      <h1>Assessments</h1>
      <h2>Code Journal Entries (Dailies)</h2>
      <p>20-25% of the mark for each course will be earned by submitting entries to a daily(ish) code journal.</p>
      <h3>Why a code journal?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Track your progress. Sometimes it's difficult to notice how much you've learned if you can't laugh at how hard things use to seem.</li>
        <li>Reminders for helpful resources.</li>
        <li>Allow Instructors/Facilitators to provide feedback on your learning/coding process.</li>
        <li>Help with problem solving. Journaling is like talking to a <a href="https://rubberduckdebugging.com/">Rubber Duck</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Marking Rubric</h3>
      <p>Each Daily will be worth 3-5% and could contain one or more of the following to earn marks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reflection: insight into your thought process while you were performing some nerdy activity.</li>
        <li>Attributions and references: such as links to helpful articles/videos/documentation.</li>
        <li>Session documentation: such as plans and preparation for work.</li>
        <li>Proof of work: such as commits to code, links to Figma designs, deployed projects, etc.</li>
        <li>Problem solving: breakdowns of bugs and problems you encountered during a session</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each course will have specific requirements and weighting for Dailies.</p>
      <h3>Submission Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Push your journal entry to GitHub.</li>
        <li>Submit a Daily in Brightspace as a comment, including: 
          <ul>
            <li>Clearly state day the journal entry is for;</li>
            <li>Link to the specific entry on GitHub. If the entry is part of a longer page, link to the heading of that date.</li>
            <li>Links to any supporting materials, if they aren't already linked to the journal.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
