      <h1>Assessments</h1>
      <p>All assessments must be submitted to Brightspace to receive a mark. Most coding assignments will also require you to <code>push</code> your project to GitHub and deploy to a live server.</p>
      <hr>
      <h2>Code Journal Entries (Dailies)</h2>
      <p>20-25% of the mark for each course will be earned by submitting entries to a daily(ish) code journal.</p>
      <h3>Marking Rubric</h3>
      <p>Each Daily will be worth 3-5% and could contain one or more of the following to earn marks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reflection: insight into your thought process while you were performing some nerdy activity.</li>
        <li>Attributions and references: such as links to helpful articles/videos/documentation.</li>
        <li>Session documentation: such as plans and preparation for work.</li>
        <li>Proof of work: such as commits to code, links to Figma designs, deployed projects, etc.</li>
        <li>Problem solving: breakdowns of bugs and problems you encountered during a session</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each course will have specific requirements and weighting for Dailies.</p>
      <h3>Submission Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Push your journal entry to GitHub.</li>
        <li>Submit a Daily in Brightspace as a comment, including: 
          <ul>
            <li>Clearly state day the journal entry is for;</li>
            <li>Link to the specific entry on GitHub. If the entry is part of a longer page, link to the heading of that date.</li>
            <li>Links to any supporting materials, if they aren't already linked to the journal.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>Notes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Journal entries are not required every day. Each course will require 4-6 entries, due at various points in the schedule.</li>
        <li>If English is not your first language, you may write your journal in your native language if you can find a way to auto-translate it for your instructors (unless the auto-translate sucks).</li>
      </ul>
      <hr>
      <h2>Assignments</h2>
      <p>Besides your coding journal, the majority of your assessments will take the form of assignments, each worth 10-25% of the course mark. Requirements, weighting and rubrics will be announced with the individual assignments as the program progresses.</p>
      <h3>Late Penalties</h3>
      <p>10% of your assignment mark will be deducted for each day late. Assignments will not be accepted more than three days late.</p>
      <p>Marks will be returned within 10 days of submission, but hopefully sooner.</p>
