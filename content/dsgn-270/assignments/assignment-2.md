## Instructions
### Part 1: Navigation Breakdown
1. Select a large, multi-page website that includes the types of navigation listed below. Include the title and url at the top of this section.
2. Using one (or more) screencaps and an annotation tool of your choice, find and label an example of the each following:
    - Global navigation
    - Local navigation
    - Utility navigation
    - One (or more) of the following:
        - Breadcrumb navigation
        - Hamburger navigation (open menu)
        - Sticky header
        - Hero footer

### Part 2: Hero Section Critique
1. Find a hero section with a Call-to-Action (CTA) that is either a very good or very bad example of visual hierarchy. This can be a different website than you used in Part 1.
2. Website summary: In 50 words or less, define: 
    - the target audience that this website caters to; 
    - the value/benefit this website provides to its users.
3. Call-to-Action Critique: In 150-200 words, and using terminology covered in class, evaluate the website's Call-to-Action:
    - Is it an effective Call-to-Action?
    - What action is the website asking its users to perform?
    - Evaluate its use of visual hierarchy, such as:
        - Colour and contrast;
        - Size and scale;
        - White/negative space;
        - Imagery;
        - Typography and content;
        - Repetition.
    - Include a screencap (and annotations, if desired) to support your argument.
