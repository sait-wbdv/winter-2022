description: Build a prototype of a web page in figma.
---

- Due: March 21
- Weight: 20%

## Scenario

Your job is to build a prototype of a website for the developers on your team. This prototype needs to show how navigation between 3 pages will work, and how the page will scale to mobile.

In order to improve your developer speed, you will also use a figma plugin to export either tailwind or css styles.

The goal of this is to establish a sense of style and consistent movement around the page. Content can be all placeholder. The important detail is to create an easy to follow design.

## Instructions

- In Figma, create a mockup of a landing page and 2 other web page for the same site.
- Create a design system for your:
  - fonts
  - colors
- Create figma components for reusable ui elements (cards, buttons, panels)
- Add prototyping for site navigation
- Export your styles to css or tailwind for developers
