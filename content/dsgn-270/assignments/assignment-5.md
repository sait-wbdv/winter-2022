---

- Due: March 22
- Weight: 20%

## Scenario

Your job is to build a prototype of a website for the developers on your team. This prototype needs to show how navigation between 3 pages will work, and how the page will scale to mobile.

In order to improve your developer speed, you will also use a figma plugin to export either tailwind or css styles.

The goal of this is to establish a sense of style and consistent movement around the page. Content can be all placeholder. The important detail is to create an easy to follow design.

## Instructions

  - fonts
  - colors
- Create figma components for reusable ui elements (cards, buttons, panels)
- Add prototyping for site navigation
- Add add prototyping for one feature of your website (can be a button animation or other)
