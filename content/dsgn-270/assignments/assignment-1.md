description: A description
---
## Scenario
You are the only UX/UI savvy dev on your development team for a mobile app. After an initial requirements meeting, you realize a little UX will help the team visualize their work.

You decide to create a small proof of concept document to hopefully get buy-in from your teammates.

## Instructions
1. Select a mobile website of your choice or make one up. 
2. In 50 words or less, summarize the purpose of the website to provide context for the rest of this assignment.
3. Create 3 User Stories related to the website in one unordered list.
4. For one of the User Stories, create one 5-step (at least) Task Flow as a numbered list.
5. Create at least 3 mobile wireframe screens to support the chosen user flow.

## Marking Criteria
This assignment will be marked out of 25 points, which will be given for each of the following:

### User stories: 10 points
- Stories should the following grammatical format (or similar): 
    > As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value].
- Each story should fit the INVEST set of criteria.
- Stories should be 20-30 words.
- Stories should be presented as an unordered list.
- Each Story action (What) and benefit/value (Why) should be distinct from the other two.

### Task flow: 5 points
The task flow should:
- reference which Story you've chosen.
- have the same starting point for all users;
- be 5 tasks or more;
- show only one path and not show branches;
- end in success;
- be presented as a numbered list.

Each task should be:
- short and concise;
- be user-centric (no system processes included);
- focus on actions that trigger screen or layout transitions. 
    - For example: "user submits form" instead of "user enters username..."

### Wireframe: 5 points
- Screens should be low-fidelity but contain the major page elements.
- Annotate your wireframes with Task Flow step numbers. Add arrows, if necessary, to better communicate the task.
- All wireframe screens should be included in your document as a single image no larger than an 8"x10" page when printed (can be either portrait or landscape) and be embedded in your document.

### General: 5 points
Points will be deducted for lack of scannability:
- Text is concise and legible.
- The composition of page elements (headings, lists, body text, images, etc) supports visual hierarchy.
- The content focuses on a dominant message.
