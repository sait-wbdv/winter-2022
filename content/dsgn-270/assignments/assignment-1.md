description: A description
---
## Scenario
You are the only UX/UI savvy dev on your development team for a mobile app. After an initial requirements meeting, you realize a little UX will help the team visualize their work.

You decide to create a small proof of concept document to hopefully get buy-in from your teammates.

## Instructions
1. Select a mobile website of your choice (except Amazon; see below) or make one up. 
2. In 50 words or less, summarize the purpose of the website to provide context for the rest of this assignment.
3. Create 3 User Stories related to the website in one unordered list.
4. For ONE of the User Stories, create one 5-step (at least) User Flow as a numbered list.
5. Create at least 3 mobile wireflow screens (wireframes labelled with user flow steps) to support the chosen user flow.

## Marking Criteria
This assignment will be marked out of 20 points, which will be given for each of the following:

### User stories: 5 points
- Stories should the following grammatical format (or similar): 
    > As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value].

    - See: [Agile User Stories](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/6f8b416c4c409c60148581f7ec806c46)
    
- Each story should fit the INVEST set of criteria.
- Stories should be a maximum of 30 words.
- Stories should be presented as an unordered list.
- Each Story action (What) and benefit/value (Why) should be distinct from the other two.

### Task flow: 5 points
The task flow should:
- reference which Story you've chosen.
- have the same starting point for all users;
- be 5 tasks or more;
- show only one path and not show branches;
- end in success;
- be presented as a numbered list.

Each task should be:
- short and concise;
- be user-centric (no system processes included);
- focus on actions that trigger screen or layout transitions. 
    - For example: "user submits form" instead of "user enters username..."

### Wireframe: 5 points
- Screens should be low-fidelity but contain the major page elements.
- Annotate your wireframes with Task Flow step numbers. Add arrows, if necessary, to better communicate the task.
- All wireframe screens should be included in your document as a single image no larger than an 8"x10" page when printed (can be either portrait or landscape) and be embedded in your document.

### General: 5 points
Points will be deducted for lack of scannability:
- Text is concise and legible.
- The composition of page elements (headings, lists, body text, images, etc) supports visual hierarchy.
- The content focuses on a dominant message.
