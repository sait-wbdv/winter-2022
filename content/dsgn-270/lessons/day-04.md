## 1. Figma Review
### Materials

- [Figma Drawing Tools Overview](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/courses/using-figma-for-svg-design/lessons/drawing-tools-overview)
- [5 of your favorite Illustrator tools in Figma](https://medium.com/@saintasia/5-of-your-favorite-illustrator-tools-in-figma-a7c2aaa45d59)

### Activity: Pick a company/client/theme for your logo/mood board
Suggestions:
- Create a random company/client using Tony's [Namor App](https://acidtone.github.io/namor/) ([with adjectives](https://acidtone.github.io/namor/?adjectives=true))
- Redesign a logo/brand that already exists but needs a refresh
- Build a logo for a friend, family member, yourself

## 2. Demo: Tracing with the Pen Tool
### Materials
- [Using Shape Tools](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450133-Using-Shape-Tools)
- [Vector Networks](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450213-Vector-networks)
- See [All Figma Guides](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450213-Vector-networks)

### Activity: Trace a silhouette
1. Find an image in our list of [Openly Licensed Content](https://sait-wbdv.netlify.app/library/open-content/) (for example) that has a shape you'd like to trace.
2. Place this image into a Frame in Figma, reduce the opacity and lock the layer.
3. Practice tracing this shape using the Pen Tool (_not_ the Pencil Tool).

There will be a show-and-tell for the best and worst creations after the activity.

## 3. Demo: Boolean operations (Pathfinder in Illustrator)
### Materials
- [Boolean Operations in Figma](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039957534-Boolean-Operations)

### Activity: Create a custom shape
1. Do a search for "[sunset logo](https://www.google.com/search?q=sunset+logo)" (for example).
2. Try to re-create this image in Figma using the tools/techniques learned in class.

There will be a show-and-tell for the best and worst creations after the activity.

## 4. Demo: Create Outlines from Fonts
### Materials

## Lab Time
### Mood board challenge - Earn a 9am start tomorrow
Submit a screencap of a Logo Mood Board of at least 9 items to the `#winter-2022` in Slack.
1. Pick a general theme/company/client/project that you will build a logo for in Assignment 3.
2. Do some research and screencap/collect inspiration that captures the mood of your logo subject, such as: 
    - (minimalist) logo examples, 
    - Images you can trace, 
    - Illustrations and line art, 
    - Typography and (Google) fonts, 
    - Colour palettes, 
    - Any other items that help you (or a hypothetical client) visualize your logo for Assignment 3.
3. Organize your findings in a Figma/Figjam workspace. Start with a simple 3x3 grid of 9 images if you're having trouble.
4. Screencap your mood board and post it to `#winter-2022`.

If 90% of the class submits a board **by the end of class**, we start at 9am tomorrow morning!
