## Design Systems

A design system is very useful for creating mockups and prototypes quickly and consistently. A design system is a set of rules regarding visual elements such as: color, typography, spacing, border radius, and pseudo states.

A design system also include commonly used components such as buttons, cards, panels. Just like with the style assets, you can take a very structured approach to your components, or you can set up a minimal system. It depends on the scope of the project.

We are going to create a design system in Figma. These will be applied to both our mockups as well as our actual code. This is possible by using Figma plugins to export stylesheets based on our design systems.
