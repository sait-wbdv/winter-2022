## One-on-ones for NON-coding help
Direct Message an Instructor/Facilitator at any time if you have a private non-coding concern or question.

For questions about code and related topics, see below:

## Getting programming help
There is only one instructor (per course) but many students. Three key skills we will be teaching in this program are:
1. Independent learning
2. How to ask for help
3. Knowing when to ask for help

These are skills employers look for when they hire Juniors.

### Debugging
We recommend you follow these steps when you run into a problem:
1. Troubleshoot! This is how you learn to code: through your fingers.
    - Are there syntax errors? 
    - Did you validate your code?
    - Can you reproduce the error reliably?
    - Any theories?
2. Using the proper terminology, search for solutions online;
    - And learn to recognize the quality of a search result;
3. More troubleshooting!
4. [Talk to a rubber duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/);
    - It seems silly but just talking through a problem out loud will often lead to a potential solution. The mind is funny that way.
5. If you're still stuck, ask for help (and be respectful of someone's time) from:
    - your classmates, using the `#fall-2021` Slack channel (so others can benefit from the discussion);
    - outside nerds, such as forums, Discord servers, etc;
    - your instructor, keeping in mind they will ask you if you've attempted any of the above steps.

### Slack best practices
- `@mention` someone if it's important or a direct reply to someone's message. This will send the person a notification (by default) but don't overuse it.
- Can your question be answered by a classmate? Consider posting it in `#fall-2021` instead of a Direct Message. The answer will probably be of use to the rest of the group (don't forget to work the problem yourself, first).
- Don't wait for someone to be online before asking them a question. Just ask the question and give the person some time to respond.
    - The goal of asynchronous messaging apps is to provide enough information so that someone can help while you're offline. 
    - Think like you're sending an email (asynchronous), not live chatting (synchronous).
    - Examples of flawed Slack messages:
        - "Hi @tony" (and then nothing after)
        - "@tony I'd like to ask a question" (and then nothing after)
    - Examples of great Slack messages:
        - "_I can't figure out how to move this button to the left. Any ideas? Screencap attached! Here's a link to the GitHub code! I think it's a problem with line 25._"
            - You've been staring at the same code for awhile. Others haven't. Point them in the right direction.
        - "_@katy Free at 5pm for a strategy chat? If not, I'm free tomorrow during lunch._"
            - Providing backup options reduce the need for back-and-forth discussion.
- Want to meet any past grads? Post a message in `#general`.
