## Lab Day

- [Publish a webpage with Git and GitHub Pages](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/5d45f96bc11fada75038e552f9ba1a5c)

  There's no need to complete this project before class. We'll be working on this during the session.

  Windows users will need Git Bash (or similar bash terminal), which is installed with Git. The Command Prompt is not recommended. Mac and Unix use bash terminals by default.
