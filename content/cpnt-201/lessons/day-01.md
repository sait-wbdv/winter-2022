### Activity: Follow the white rabbit
A command line challenge:
1. Download or clone [this directory] into your workspace
2. Navigate to the root of this directory in your terminal
3. There is an image of a white rabbit somewhere in this directory. Navigate to it using the `pwd`, `cd` and `ls` commands.
4. Daily: Take a screencap of your terminal history with a `ls` showing that you're in the same directory as the white rabbit image.
