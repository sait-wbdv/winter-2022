## Details

In this assignment, you will deploy three _distinct_ static website templates that could be customized for a fictitious business of your choice.

**Scenario**: You have landed a new client! They want to choose a template for their new website at the next meeting. You want to impress them with three websites that are:

- deployed (i.e. published) on GH Pages
- visually distinct with respect to UX/UI
- customized with the company name and logo
  - the name can be made up
  - the logo can be an icon from Font Awesome or similar source

## Instructions

1. Search online for three _distinct_ static website templates that could be customized for your selected client;
2. Deploy each template to GH Pages, naming each repo "cpnt201-a1-[template-name]";
3. Make at least three customizations to _each_ template **as separate commits**.
   - At the end of this assignment, you should have made at least 12 commits; three for each of the three customizations, plus your initial commits (which are not counted for marks).

## Criteria
1. Distinctiveness
   - Each template should offer a diverse choice for the client by:
     - being visually distinct from the other two templates;
     - representing, collectively, a wide variety of layout elements (cards, sliders, gallery, etc).
     - be from different template authors (but they can be from the same marketplace).
2. Functionality
   - Each template should be responsive, and
   - have the potential to be a multi-page site.
3. Deployment
   - Each template should be deployed using GitHub Pages (_not_ with a GH theme) and be viewable on a mobile device.
4. Committed Customizations
   - Each template repository should have at least three commits (in addition to your initial commit) that customizes content on the home page. For example:
     - page titles and headings (commit 1),
     - page logo/icon (commit 2),
     - primary navigation (commit 3).
   - Each change should be captured in its own commit with a descriptive message.
   - Your initial commit should be the base template with no modifications.
   - The changes themselves will not be marked but cannot break the design.
