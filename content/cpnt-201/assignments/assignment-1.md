## Details
In this assignment, you will deploy your code journal, where you will submit your Dailies for the rest of the program.

## Why start a Code Journal?
- To track your progress. Sometimes it's difficult to notice how much you've learned if you can't laugh at how hard things use to seem.
- Reminders for helpful resources.
- Allow Instructors/Facilitators to provide feedback on your learning/coding process.
- Help with problem solving. Journaling is like talking to a[Rubber Duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/).

## Instructions
1. Install Git, VS code and create a GitHub account.
2. Follow the steps outlined in [Publish a webpage with Git and GitHub Pages](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/5d45f96bc11fada75038e552f9ba1a5c)
3. Write, commit and push a first journal entry in the README file of your new repo.
    - Note: you may choose another file/location for your entry as long as you make it obvious for your instructors to mark.

## Marking Rubric
This assignment will be marked out of 20 points.

### 5 points: Initial pushed commit: 
- GH repo named `code-journal` or similar;
- Repo initialized with a commit message of `initial commit` or similar (this is convention).

### 5 points: Git configuration
- Local email address set correctly in your config
- GitHub Profile updated with:
  - Profile photo
  - Bio
  - Location (Calgary or more specific)
  - Optional: website, Twitter, etc

### 5 points: Journal entry
Now that you have a code journal deployed, you need your first journal entry. Organize and format it so that it makes sense to you, but here are some basic requirements to make marking easier:

- The body of your entry should contain:
   - one paragraph
   - one bulleted list of two or more items

### 5 points: Flare
Flare points are bells/whistles/polish that you can add to any assignment for extra marks. We'll give you options and the Flare is up to you.

For this assignment you may add ONE (two doesn't give you any more marks) of the following:

**Either:**
- Make three changes, each with their own commit and descriptive commit message;
- OR, Add a GH Pages theme to your journal;
- OR, Make a change to your journal using a branch:
   1. Create a new branch in your journal repo;
   2. Make changes in this branch and commit them;
   3. Push your branch to GitHub;
   4. Merge your branch into `main`;
   5. Push the `main` branch to GitHub.
