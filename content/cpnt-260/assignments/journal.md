---

## Details

Just like with other parts of this course, you will be documenting your process through a series of code journals. Each of these will be graded out of 4 and are based on your work over a couple days.

### Overview

- Journal 1 Due: January 21 at 11:59pm
- Journal 2 Due: January 24 at 11:59pm
- Journal 3 Due: January 28 at 11:59pm
- Journal 4 Due: February 1 at 11:59pm
- Journal 5 Due: February 4 at 11:59pm

### Requirements

- These are meant to support your learning and evolution as a programmer. So there is no set structure to them. **however you do need to link your journal to code that it references**
- They must be written in markdown and submitted to brightspace
  - you can use the same method as done for journals in cpnt-201 **or** you can use hackmd or just submit a readme file.
- They can include any to all of these topics (and others depending on what you're working on)
  - Insights about how a piece of syntax works
  - Debugging process
  - Bug report
  - Notes about workflow processes that worked well or that caused more issues.

## Marking Rubric

Each entry will be worth 5 points, for a total of 20 points. 2.5 points will be given for the following:

### 1. Self-assessment

Learning objective: To accurately self-assess learning performance.

**Full marks**

- Student has demonstrated accurate self-assessment skills and/or has demonstrated quantifiable improvement toward their learning goals.

**Partial marks**

- There are areas for improvement. For example:
  - Learning goal(s) is not concrete/precise;
  - Performance metrics are not quantifiable;
  - More reflection needed.

**Minimal marks**

- Little or no attempt was made to self-assess learning performance.

### 2. Proof of Work

Learning objective: To capture learning artifacts (code, references, ideas, reminders, etc) for future review by the student, classmates or instructor.

**Full marks**

- At least three artifacts have been recorded in the entry.

**Half marks**

- Less than three artifacts have been recorded in the entry.

**Minimal marks**

- Little or no proof of work has been recorded.

## Submission Instructions

- Accepted locations for dated entries:
  - As an entry in your dedicated `code-journal` repo;
  - In the README of a relevant remote repo (project, assignment, etc) under the heading "Code Journal".
- Zip your dated entry and submit it to Brightspace.
- As a comment to your submission, include:
  - a link to the specific file and heading of your dated entry.
    - Example: [Jan 1st entry](https://github.com/acidtone/code-journal#jan-1-2022) in Tony's `code-journal`

## Example content

### Self-assessment

- What concrete and precise goals have you set for yourself?
  - "I want to set aside a half-hour every day, dedicated to coding"
  - "I want to get a great search result with phrase that's 3 words or less"
  - "I want to push a commit every day"
  - "I want to review the Prep before every class"
  - "I want to attempt one tutorial every Lab Time this week"
- What metrics are you basing your performance on?
  - the search terms you're using
  - GitHub activity
  - number of labs completed in class
  - amount of time spent coding
  - number of pair-coding sessions attempted
- Are you meeting the expectations you've set for yourself?
- What steps can you take to learn more effectively?
- What are today's wins?

### Proof of Work

- Lab/tutorial/exercise attempts
  - What concrete and precise goal do you have for the session? What problem are you trying to solve?
  - What's the plan?
  - Numbered steps you've taken to complete the objective
  - Observations, obstacles encountered, solutions found.
  - Links to starting and finishing commits (if applicable)
  - Reflection: was the objective achieved? Why or why not?
- Class notes
  - video timestamp markers for important information
  - instructor/classmate quotes
  - observations
  - helpful/useful links pasted in the Chat
  - questions for later
  - reminders for Lab Time
  - What topics covered in class has interested you the most?
  - TODOs
- Research sessions
  - What questions do you want to answer?
  - What search terms are you using?
  - Could the author/content creator be a good source for information in the future?
- Useful links, resources and attributions
