## Details

Just like with other parts of this course, you will be documenting your process through a series of code journals. Each of these will be graded out of 4 and are based on your work over a couple days.

### Requirements

- These are meant to support your learning and evolution as a programmer. So there is no set structure to them. **however you do need to link your journal to code that it references**
- They must be written in markdown and submitted to brightspace
  - you can use the same method as done for journals in cpnt-201 **or** you can use hackmd or just submit a readme file.
- They can include any to all of these topics (and others depending on what you're working on)
  - Insights about how a piece of syntax works
  - Debugging process
  - Bug report
  - Notes about workflow processes that worked well or that caused more issues.

## Marking Rubrick **4pts Each**

- Heading and paragraph or list content **2pts**
- Address at least one topic **1pt**
- Flare: **1pt**
  - Write an instructional step by step on how to code something
  - Write a step by step about how to find and fix a bug related to your journal
  - _note that these flares do not need to be very long_
