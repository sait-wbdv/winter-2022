<home-work :home-work="homework">

This is a lot of content to review. Take some time to explore it over the weekend as well.

Before class, please focus on reading through the css-tricks complete guide to flexbox

## Overview

### Semantic HTML Recap Notes

- review [this gist](https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/be85b495d534d3482fd7e9b1680e282b) for information on using semantic html

### Code Review

- Discuss [wiki article activity](https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/7371f05b2deb3862eb4ca54e27c21299)
  - discussion prompts (discussion content can be used in code journals):
    - what worked well?
    - what was challenging?
    - what new ideas did you come up with while working on this?

### Today's Activity: [Navigation Bar](https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/b20b36f46354e74b1efafcfa5c170d1a)

- Due: Saturday Jan 22 @ 11:59Pm
- This can be just a nav bar in a codepen similar to [this example](https://codepen.io/lilyx/pen/xxXMwYp)

### [Assignment 1: About Page](/cpnt-260/assignments/assignment-1)

- Due: Tuesday January 25 @ 11:59PM
  - Write an about page for yourself, a client, about a product, company, character, movie. No Lorem Ipsum

## Topic 1: HTML Document structure

- Moving from codepen to vscode, we need to add a few more bits of code to our html documents
  - the `html`, `head`, and `body` tags are used to structure the html document for proper rendering of content and assets

#### the `<html></html>` tag

- put everything in side of these tags

#### The html `<head></head>` tag

- this is **not** the same as the `<header></header>` tag
- In the head, you add metadata, the site title (which renders in browser tabs), link stylesheets, and add script tags
- Note that while online tools such as codepen will manage the head tag for you, when you write an html page in vscode, you **must** include a head tag with relevant information. the emmet plugin helps by writing a boiler plate of this for you, but you will need to add your stylesheets etc to it.

#### the `<body></body>` tag

- this is where you will code anything seen on the web page. Put your semantic html inside the body tags

#### Example Page structure

- this is like the code generated by writing `html:5` at the top of your `.html` page

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!-- these metadata tags are good defaults -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Site title goes here</title>
  <!-- link fonts and stylesheets here -->
</head>
<body>
<!-- enter page content here -->
</body>
</html>
```

## Topic 2: Code Indentation and CSS Selector Nesting

### Code Indentation

- Indentation is very important, in some languages it's necessary for code to run
- Any HTML elements that are _within_ a container element must be nested inside using indents
  - You can use hotkeys to auto indent your code. This saves a lot of time

### CSS Selector nesting

- In bruteforce mode, it's normaly to add classes directly to elements
- After everything works like you want, your optimization process should include removing redundent code
- A good practice is to add a class to a parent element and then use nested selectors on it's children
  - `nav.parent-class a {/* link styles */}`

---

## Responsive Fonts

### Terminology

These css properties and values are especially useful for setting responsive fonts.

- `clamp()`
  : Use clamp to set minimum and maximum font size and the range that they increase and decrease by. ie: `font-size: clamp(1.2rem, 2.5vw, 1.4rem)`
- `text-align`
  : align text left, center, right, or justified. [Mdn article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align).
- `max-width` and `min-width`
  : Both of these will override the `width` property. And `min-width` will override `max-width`.
- `rem`
  : rem units are equal to the font-size declared on a root element. 1 `rem` unit is equal to `16px`. A px is 10times bigger than a rem.

#### Font size readings

- If you are wanting to get more detailed with font-size, read this [CSS-tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/rems-ems/) which shows how to use px, em, and rem together effectively
- Read [This css tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/linearly-scale-font-size-with-css-clamp-based-on-the-viewport/) on using clamp based off viewport units

#### Font optimization Notes and Readings

- `@import` in css is slower than using `link` in html
- use `preconnect` to improve font loading times
- Link example: `<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />`
- [Optimize web fonts](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/web-fonts-in-2018-f191a48367e8/)
- [comparing preload, preconnect, and prefetch](https://george.mand.is/2019/11/whats-the-difference-between-link-preload-preconnect-and-prefetch/).

## Topic 3: Site Navigation

- Navigation should use a `nav` tag.
- You can have more than one nav
- It is conventional to put an unordered list inside your nav for links, but not essential
- To link to content on the same page, add an `id` tag to the link location and specify it in your link
  - nav link = `<a href="#link-on-page">Link</a>`, then add the id to the element like: `<h2 id="link-on-page">Text</h2>`
- To open the link in a new tab use `target="_blank"` in your link tag
- A `nav` is often found inside a `header` or above a `header`. It depends on the site

### Extra Reading

- To add a list to a nav or not is discussed in this [css-tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/navigation-in-lists-to-be-or-not-to-be/).
- A footer navigation does not necessarily need a nav element: [mdn article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav).
