## Hero Sections

Hero Sections are commonly used as headers to quickly captivate the user's attention and direct them.

<dl>
<dt>Hero Section</dt>
<dd>A section of the website that is the first thing a user sees, it's generally really big, eye catching, and seeks to convey the identity and goal of a site. Hero sections also generally have a call to action.</dd>
</dl>

- You will also hear about **hero nav** and **hero footer**
  - These are just navs and footers that have a very large and usually comprehensive dump of links
- We will just be focusing on hero sections in the header

### Hero Codepen Examples

### Key Questions

- when creating a hero section, ask yourself: If a user does 1 thing on this site, what do you want them to do?
- This question is useful for guiding hero section creation.
  Call to Action (CTA)
  : Guides the user to the next step of going to your site. Depending on the type and goal of the site, this can be many different things.

## Activity: [Hero Hunt](https://gist.github.com/lilyx13/6baa9d8a8c59b2f675008e2c8560911e)

- Screenshot different hero sections
  - look for:
    - different positions of hero content
    - animations and user interaction
    - types of CTA
  - Answer:
    - What does this hero say about the site's identity?
    - What story does it tell?
    - What kind of engagement it is directing the user to do?
    - Is it intended to make you stop and think or does it direct you along?
