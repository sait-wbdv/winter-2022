## What is a CMS?

# Content Management Systems and Site Rendering

CMS's are used to organze content on websites. This includes text content like blogs and articles, images, videos, products, etc.

Traditional CMS's like Wordpress and Drupal are built on a LAMP stack. These types of sites still make up over 40% of websites on the internet.

However new types of CMS's are starting to emerge as well. The JAMStack has recently become a serious contender due to it's flexibility, developer friendliness, optimization, and security.
