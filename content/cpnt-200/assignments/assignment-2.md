## Overview

Whether you are creating content in a monolithic cms, or a headless cms like Storyblok, your approach to structuring content is will be one of the most important aspects of your work. The ability to take a structured, organized, and maintainable approach will differentiate between a professional and amateur project. This assignment will help you develop your skills with regards to building reusable components and content organization.

Many editors such as wordpress and squarespace allow all manner of organizing data, enabling bad practices to cripple otherwise good projects. In Storyblok, you will take a premeditated approach to setting up your content fields and content types so that information is consistent to access and create.

### Deliverables

For this assignment, you will create 3 content types that will be made up of smaller nestable components.

- Create these content types:
  - Page or Section
  - Article
  - Card
- To optimize your workflow, you will need to create nestable components that are used in the above content types. Create at least 5 nestable components, these are some examples to get you started:
  - cta
  - page_header
  - image
  - article_text
  - card_info
  - title

You will also submit a README.md file that contains your personal reflection from testing.

## Instructions

1. Create a new space named cpnt-a2
2. Create your content types, make sure they are **not** nestable
3. Fill out descriptions as discussed in class
4. Plan out your content types:
   - what content do they need?
   - what nestable components will you need?
5. Create nestable components for each content type (try to make as many reusable components as possible)
6. Set up your fields with accurate descriptions and configurations.
   - For full marks, your design should be accessible to a content editor who has no prior knowledge of what you've done
7. Test your content types by trying to use them. You can use any content that you want provided that the licenses allow and you attribute it.
   - Write up a brief personal reflection after your first test in your README. Document what felt like it needed to be changed and how you changed it. Point form is fine.
8. Optimize your components
   - Remove, add, or edit your components based on your testing.
