### Key Takeaways
- Svelte does not use the `<template>` element for HTML; it floats freely inside the page.
- SvelteKit is similar to Nuxt and adds app support and server-side rendering.
- Svelte is now at version 3 but SvelteKit 1.0 is still in public beta.
- SvelteKit is "opinionated", meaning it forces you to build your apps a certain way.

#### Pros
- Easier to use.
- SvelteKit is "compiled away" and creates an app that uses vanilla JS, leading to smaller code with no virtual DOM.
- Great for hobby sites and simple web apps.

#### Cons
- SvelteKit is missing many features and components that Nuxt has.
- The SvelteKit API is still changing and is not stable.
- Not recommended for production, although this hasn't stopped companies from using it.
