## Documentation
<section class="cards">

1. **Project Proposal: _10 points_**
    Some text:
    - Write a professional-level proposal for your final project.
    - Detailed requirements to be announced on Day 3.
    - [Example proposal](/files/examples/Example-Website-Proposal.pdf)
2. **Lean Canvas: _10 points_**
    - Document Plan A of your final project using Lean Canvas
    - Detailed requirements to be announced on Day 3.
3. **Taskflow: _5 points_**
    - Complete a minimum 8-item Taskflow for a well defined User Story related to your project.
    - Submit as a markdown or README file to Brightspace.
4. **Wireframes/Mockups: _5 points_**
    - Complete either low-fidelity wireframes or high-fidelity mockups for at least 5 screens based on a well defined User Story related to your project.
    - Submit screencaps of your wireframes to Brightspace.
6. **Task Board: _1 point per feature (max 10 points)_**
    - Using GH Projects, Trello or similar task tracking tool:
        1. Optional: Create a "Final Presentation" repo for your tasks.
        2. Create a card representing a task you need to complete for your final presentation. Put it in a _To Do_, _Backlog_ or similar list.
        3. To submit: Take screencap of project board and total your point for a single Brightspace submission.
    - A "Task" is loosely defined but it should be a non-trivial activity that brings you closer to your Final Presentation project. Examples:
        - "Implement personal access token for _GitHub_ API"
        - "Create logic flowchart for sign-in process"
        - "Create image gallery from JSON data using fetch and a loop"
    - Tasks should be submitted in good faith: no cheesy tasks like "tie shoelaces".

</section>

Note: A project proposal can be combined with lean canvas documentation for a combined **15 points**. All other items can be built independently or as supporting documentation for a Proposal/Canvas.
