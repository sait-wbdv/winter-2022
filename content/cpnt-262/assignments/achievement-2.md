## Instructions
Copy/download/clone these [starter files](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/383cf362c923f5126ecb32621dc7c0d4) into your workspace. In `client.js`:
1. Declare a variable with a name of your choice.

    - Suggestions for beginners:
        - `String`: Your name?
        - `Number`: Your age?
        - `Boolean`: Do you like anime?
3. Print the variable (Before) with `console.log`.
4. Print the the variable again (After), but changed in some way, such as:

    - increment a `Number` with the [increment operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Increment) (`++`)
    - Reverse a Boolean value with the [logical NOT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_NOT) (`!`) operator
    - Output the number of items in an array with [`Array.length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/length)
    - Ask a classmate/facilitator for any other suggestions.
5. Include a `README.md` file with the following information:
    - Your name, course and assignment title;
    - Attributions: **Did anyone help you?** Give credit to any classmates, articles, tutorials, etc that helped you complete this project.
