- Due: Friday, Feb 18 @ 11:59pm
- Weight: 5% of the final mark

## Learning Outcomes
This achievement will be marked out of **5 points** where you will:
- **1 point**: Declare an empty `output` variable and incrementally build a string using the addition assignment (`+=`) operator.
- **2 points**: Loop through an array of items using a loop of your choice.
- **1 point**: Assign a finished `output` string to an HTML element using `Element.innerHTML` or `Node.textContent`.
- **1 point**: Document this activity in a Code Journal section of the project README (see last step in the [Instructions](#instructions)).

## Instructions
1. Find or create an array of items of your choice. See [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/61ed05c9fe7fe85fd278ea9a84db7203) for examples.
2. Declare an empty string variable called `output` or similar.
3. Loop through each item of the array using a loop statement of your choice (i.e. `for` loop or `Array.forEach()` method).
4. Using the loop and the addition assignment (`+=`) operator, add each item to the `output` variable. You must change the item in some way, such as:
    - add HTML to create a numbered or bulleted list;
    - capitalize each word;
    - build links to other websites;
    - etc.
5. At the end of the loop, assign the value of the `output` variable to a page element of your choice.
6. Include a `README.md` file with the following information:
    - Your name, course and assignment title;
    - Attributions: **Did anyone help you?** Give credit to any classmates, articles, tutorials, etc that helped you complete this project.
    - Journal: Include self-assessments, observations, research, etc under the heading "Code Journal". 

Points will be deducted for code that is too similar to examples shown in class or is uncommented.
