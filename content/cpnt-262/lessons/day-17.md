## What is today about?

Today we are going to pair code to create a small website using all the concepts that we have learned. At the end of the day, each team will showcase their work at the end of the day.

Everything that you do in this can be used for your achievements. However you will need to make sure that your name is in the package.json etc and that you are able to submit your own repo for any submissions that you may use this work for.

### What do we get out of this??

- If each team submits a github repo with a vue project made in this mini hackathon, we will have late start on Thursday
- If every single person submits a github repo as noted above, then Monday will also be a late start day.
- This is also an excellent opportunity to prepare for your group work that will be coming up, as well as for practicing and sharpening your skills

## What are the rules?

- Create a web page about whatever you want
- Use whatever approach to css you want (but stick with 1 approach)
- Teams can be of 2 or 3 (they will be assigned)
- Use a git based workflow
  - One person initializes and the other is added as a collaborator
  - Add all of your group member names to the README file
  - **for full submission, the collaborator(s) need to fork the repo and change the name in package.json**
- You can use a formal pair code approach, or divide and conquer
- Use the challenges listed below
  - You don't need to progress to a new challenge with every sprint, but dont jump ahead
- **Hack like there's no tomorrow**

### Structure of the session

- Work in 30 minute sprints
- We will break for full team debriefs after each spring
  - Present problems, and topics that you're working on
  - Decide to continue with same work, or switch up challenges
- End with Show and Tell (last hour of class)
