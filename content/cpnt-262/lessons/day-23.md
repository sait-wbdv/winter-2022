## 1. Prep for CPNT 265 Final Projects
It's time to find a Final Project if you haven't already.

### Presentation format
- 5 minutes for individuals
- 10 minutes for groups of up to three

### Project Ideas
Your choice of Final Project is up to you as long as it demonstrates the skills you've acquired during this program. It's encouraged that you also demonstrate new skills and technologies not covered in class. 

Example projects from past presentations:
- Build a game! Past students have made 
    - blackjack, 
    - poker, 
    - simple dungeon crawler,
    - CSS-based centipede game controlled with the keyboard,
    - a clone of [this dinosaur game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Game) using animate.js
- Design a website for a family member, company/product idea, your portfolio, etc. While you're at it, implement it in Vue/Nuxt.
- Develop an app that would make your life easier or shows off a personal interest. Tony's examples (note - the last two would be pretty simple for a final project): 
    - [Blendmode visualizer](https://acidtone.github.io/blendr/), - [name generator](https://acidtone.github.io/namor/),
    - [Contrast Illusion](https://acidtone.github.io/illusions/tissue-contrast/)
- Develop an app that's based on one or more JS libraries that interest you, such as:
    - An alternative to VueJS/Nuxt such as React/Next or Svelte/SvelteKit.
    - Animation with [Greensock](https://greensock.com/), [AnimeJS](https://animejs.com/), etc
    - Create 3D effects with [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/)
    - Data visualization with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)
    - Make some art with [P5.js](https://p5js.org/)
    - The internet is a big place; find one not mentioned.
- Customize an existing project demo/course
    - [15 VueJS Project Ideas: Beginner to Expert](https://dev.to/nerdjfpb/15-vue-js-project-ideas-beginner-to-expert-with-tutorial-3ec2)
- Just build something you think is cool...

### CPNT 265 Achievements

- 5 minute mini-presentations on a technical topic of your choice;

    - wireframes, mockups, flowcharts
    - task board
    - business/project proposal

## Group Project Lab Time
The rest of the day will be dedicated to Lab Time so you can work on your 262 group projects. The sooner you can complete your group obligations, the sooner you can focus on your Final Project.
