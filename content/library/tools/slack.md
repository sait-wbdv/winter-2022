Slack is the preferred messaging tool for this program and is a popular tool in industry. 

- Optional: [Install Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/downloads/) (web version available)
- Tutorials: [Slack 101](https://slack.com/intl/en-ca/resources/slack-101)

Note: The past few cohorts of this program also have access to this Slack team but each cohort has a private channel. You're free to meet and interact with past students of this program. You may also use MS Teams if you'd like to avoid outside students (and your instructor(s)).
