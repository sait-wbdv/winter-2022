> _Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality._ [from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code)

If you already have a favourite code editor, feel free to use it. Otherwise, VS Code is the (current) favourite among most web developers.

## Initial setup
- [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### Configuration
- Set indents to `2 spaces` in the VS Code Preferences.
    - For some reason, VS Code indents code with four spaces. Very embarrassing. The industry standard is to indent with two spaces.
    - You will lose marks if you indent with four spaces so be sure to make this change.

### Recommended extensions
