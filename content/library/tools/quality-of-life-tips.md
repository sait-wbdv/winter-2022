## Web development is just fancy typing.
- Take a typing course, seriously.
- Keep your hands on the "home row"
    - left index finger on `F`
    - right index finger on `J`
- When using the `shift` key (other other modifier), use the opposite hand.
    - Example: for a `$` 
        - left hand on `4`
        - right hand on `shift`

## Learn your hotkeys and shortcuts
- Key Goal: don't take your hands off the keyboard
- Keyboard shortcuts can usually be found to the right of an application's menu options.
- Use your system shortcuts to switch applications
    - Windows: `Alt` + `Tab`
    - Mac: `Command` + `Tab`
- Use keyboard shortcuts to open applications
    - Windows: `Windows` key
    - Mac: `Command` + `spacebar` and begin typing the name of the application.

## Window management for the win!
