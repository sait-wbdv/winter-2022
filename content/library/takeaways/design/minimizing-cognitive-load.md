> Unless faced with life-changing information, most site visitors won't read all of the content provided but settle for a “good-enough” answer. Better sorting and clearer writing satisfy users without exhausting the limited time they’re willing to spend on a website.

### How we really use the web:
1. **We don't read pages. we scan them.**

2. **We don't make optimal choices.** We satisfice.

3. **We don't figure out how things work.** We muddle through.
