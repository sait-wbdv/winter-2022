title: Making Clickable Elements Recognizable

## Text links
- While blue is still the safest link color, other colors work just as well as long as the links stand out clearly from the body text. If you don’t have a particular reason to prefer another color, we still recommend blue as the safest choice.
- The position of links can help you determine whether or not underlining is necessary. The navigation menu and lists, especially along the peripheral areas of the page, don’t require underlining. Their locations identify them as links.
- Test your color choice for hyperlinks to make sure that people who have colorblindness can spot them easily.
- Static items should not have the same color as hyperlinks.
- Don’t use blue text (or underline text) for nonclickable items.
- Whatever appearance you choose for hyperlinks, make sure to apply the same treatment consistently throughout your site.

## Buttons
- **Make buttons at least remotely resemble physical buttons**. In order for an object to be recognizable, it must retain the right visual cues to trigger the right associations quickly and accurately. Retain the rectangular shape (preferably with rounded corners) if you renounce the 3-D effect. Interactive components in flat design should look clickable even without heavier effects such as shadows and gradients. (In one early study, clicks increased by 416% after changing from flat to 3-D buttons. While the effect is smaller now, it's still big.)
- Conversely, **don’t make nonclickable items look like buttons**. For example, giving headings a background color will make them resemble buttons when they’re not.
- **Focus on content hierarchy within the page**. Avoid having many colorful boxes of different sizes on a page. People have difficulty picking out the clickable elements when similar-looking items compete with each other.
